# Mini React

A minimal React implementation built from scratch for educational purposes.

## Overview

This project is a step-by-step implementation of React's core features, inspired by Rodrigo Pombo's excellent article ["Build your own React"](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/). The goal is to understand how React works under the hood by building a simplified version of it.

## Features to Implement

- [x] Project Setup
- [ ] **Step I**: The createElement Function
- [ ] **Step II**: The render Function  
- [ ] **Step III**: Concurrent Mode
- [ ] **Step IV**: Fibers
- [ ] **Step V**: Render and Commit Phases
- [ ] **Step VI**: Reconciliation
- [ ] **Step VII**: Function Components
- [ ] **Step VIII**: Hooks

## Learning Goals

- Understand React's virtual DOM concept
- Learn about the Fiber architecture
- Implement concurrent rendering
- Build a reconciliation algorithm
- Create function components and hooks
- Gain insights into React's rendering pipeline

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mini-react.git
cd mini-react

# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install

# Start development
# (Instructions will be added as we progress)
```

## Implementation Notes

This implementation prioritizes simplicity and educational value over performance and production-readiness. Some features and optimizations present in the real React are intentionally omitted to keep the code focused and understandable.

### Key Differences from Real React

- No optimizations for performance
- Simplified reconciliation algorithm
- No keys for list reconciliation
- No error boundaries
- No context API
- Limited lifecycle methods
